# Riddler-AI

Me and my team participated in hackathon brewing codes by UpGrad and we made a voice assistant study buddy, which will play game of Riddles on a educational topic of your choice. OpenAI's api is used.  

If you are trying to run it on your own device you might run into some problems installing the dependencies, it is recommended to upload it on google drive and run using google Colab
